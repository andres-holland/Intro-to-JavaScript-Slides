                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p> Because JavaScript is notorious for being 
                    the world's most misunderstood programming language. While it is 
                    often derided as a toy, beneath its deceptive simplicity lie some 
                    powerful language features. JavaScript is now used by an incredible number of high-profile applications, showing that deeper knowledge of this technology is an important skill for any web or mobile developer.</p>

                                JavaScript is an object-oriented dynamic language with 
                                types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods.
                            </li>
                            <li class="fragment">Syntax is based on the Java and C languages — so many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well.</li>
                            <li class="fragment">One main difference is that functions are objects, giving functions the capacity to hold executable code and be passed around like any other object.

                        <h2>Strings</h2>
                        <div class="left-align">
                            <p class="">Strings in JavaScript are sequences of characters. More accurately, they are sequences of Unicode characters, with each character represented by a 16-bit number. This should be welcome news to anyone who has had to deal with internationalization.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                If you want to represent a single character, you just use a string of length 1.
                                <br/>
                                To find the length of a string, access its length property:
                            </p>
                            <pre class="fragment">
                                <code>"hello".length; // 5</code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <div class="left-align">
                            <p class="">There's our first brush with JavaScript objects! Did we mention that you can use strings like objects too? They have methods as will that allow you to manipulate the string and access information about the string:</p>
                            <pre class="fragment">
                                <code>"hello".charAt(0); // "h"<br/>"hello, world".replace("hello", "goodbye"); // "goodbye, world"<br/>"hello".toUpperCase(); // "HELLO"</code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                </section>

                    <section>
                        <h4>Other Types</h4>
                        <div class="left-align">
                            <p class="">JavaScript distinguishes between null, which is a value that indicates a deliberate non-value (and is only accessible through the null keyword), and undefined, which is a value of type undefined that indicates an uninitialized value — that is, a value hasn't even been assigned yet. We'll talk about variables later, but in JavaScript it is possible to declare a variable without assigning a value to it.</p>
                            <p>If you do this, the variable's type is undefined. undefined is actually a constant.JavaScript has a boolean type, with possible values true and false (both of which are keywords.) Any value can be converted to a boolean according to the following rules: <p/>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                            <p class="fragment">false, 0, empty strings (""), NaN, null, and undefined all become false.All other values become true.<p/>
                            <p class="fragment">You can perform this conversion explicitly using the Boolean() function:</p>
                            <pre class="fragment">
                                <code>Boolean("");  // false
                                <br/>Boolean(234); // true</code>
                            </pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                            <p class="">However, this is rarely necessary, as JavaScript will silently perform this conversion when it expects a boolean, such as in an if statement (see below.) For this reason, we sometimes speak simply of "true values" and "false values," meaning values that become true and false, respectively, when converted to booleans. Alternatively, such values can be called "truthy" and "falsy", respectively.</p>
                            <p>Boolean operations such as &mp;&amp; (logical and), || (logical or), and ! (logical not) are supported;</p>

                        <h2>Variables</h2>
                        <div class="left-align">
                            <p>New variables in JavaScript are declared using the var keyword:</p>
                            <pre class="">
                                <code>var a;
                                <br/>var name = "simon";</code>
                            </pre>
                            <p>If you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, its type is undefined.</p>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                            <p>An important difference between JavaScript and other languages like Java is that in JavaScript, blocks do not have scope; only functions have scope. So if a variable is defined using var in a compound statement (for example inside an if control structure), it will be visible to the entire function. However, starting with ECMAScript Edition 6, let and const declarations allow you to create block-scoped variables.</p>

                        <h2>Operators</h2>
                        <p>JavaScript's numeric operators are +, -, *, / and % — which is the remainder operator (which is the same as modulo.) Values are assigned using =, and there are also compound assignment statements such as += and -=. These extend out to x = x operator y.</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                            <code>
                            x += 5<br/>
                            x = x + 5
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p class="">You can use ++ and -- to increment and decrement respectively. These can be used as prefix or postfix operators.</p>
                        <p>The + operator also does string concatenation:</p>
                        <pre class="">
                        <code>"hello" + " world"; // "hello world"</code>
                        </pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>If you add a string to a number (or other value) everything is converted in to a string first. This might catch you up:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                            <code>"3" + 4 + 5;  // "345"</br>3 + 4 + "5"; // "75"</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p class="fragment">Adding an empty string to something is a useful way of converting it to a string itself.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p class="fragment">Comparisons in JavaScript can be made using &#60;, >, &#60;= and >=. These work for both strings and numbers. Equality is a little less straightforward. The double-equals operator performs type coercion if you give it different types, with sometimes interesting results:
                        <pre class="fragment">
                        <code>123 == "123"; // true<br/>1 == true; // true</code>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>To avoid type coercion and make sure your comparisons are always accurate, you should always use the triple-equals operator:</p>
                        <pre>
                            <code>123 === "123"; // false<br/>1 === true;    // false</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>There are also != and !== operators.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript also has bitwise operations. If you want to use them, they're there</p>

                        <h2>Control Structures</h2>
                        <p>JavaScript has a similar set of control structures to other languages in the C family. Conditional statements are supported by if and else; you can chain them together if you like:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                            <code>var name = "kittens";
if (name == "puppies") {
name += "!";
} else if (name == "kittens") {
  name += "!!";
} else {
  name = "!" + name;
    }
name == "kittens!!"
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>JavaScript has while loops and do-while loops. The first is good for basic looping; the second for loops where you wish to ensure that the body of the loop is executed at least once:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
<code>while (true) {
  // an infinite loop!
}

var input;
do {
  input = get_input();
} while (inputIsNotValid(input))</code>
                        </pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p class="fragment">JavaScript's for loop is the same as that in C and Java: it lets you provide the control information for your loop on a single line.</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
<code>for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // Will execute 5 times
}</code>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>The &amp;&amp; and || operators use short-circuit logic, which means whether they will execute their second operand is dependent on the first. This is useful for checking for null objects before accessing their attributes:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
<code>var name = o && o.getName();
if(o && o.getName()){
  var name = o.getName()
}</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p class="fragment">Or for setting default values:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment"><code>var name = otherName || "default";</code></pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p class="fragment">JavaScript has a ternary operator for conditional expressions:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment"><code>var allowed = (age > 18) ? "yes" : "no";</code></pre>

                        <p class="fragment">If you don't add a break statement, execution will "fall through" to the next level. This is very rarely what you want — in fact it's worth specifically labeling deliberate fallthrough with a comment if you really meant it to aid debugging:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
<code>switch(a) {
  case 1: // fallthrough
    code here;
  case 2:

                        <p class="fragment">The default clause is optional. You can have expressions in both the switch part and the cases if you like; comparisons take place between the two using the === operator:</p>

                    <h2>Objects</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript objects can be thought of as simple collections of name-value pairs. As such, they are similar to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dictionaries in Python</li>
                        <li>Hashes in Perl and Ruby</li>
                        <li>Hash tables in C and C++</li>
                        <li>HashMaps in Java</li>
                        <li>Associative arrays in PHP</li>
                    </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>The fact that this data structure is so widely used is a testament to its versatility. Since everything (bar core types) in JavaScript is an object, any JavaScript program naturally involves a great deal of hash table lookups. It's a good thing they're so fast!</p>

                        <p>The "name" part is a JavaScript string, while the value can be any JavaScript value — including more objects. This allows you to build data structures of arbitrary complexity.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>There are two basic ways to create an empty object:</p>
                            <pre>
<code>var obj = new Object();</code>
                            </pre>
                        <p>And:</p>
                        <pre>
<code>var obj = {};</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>These are semantically equivalent; the second is called object literal syntax, and is more convenient. This syntax is also the core of JSON format and should be preferred at all times.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>Object literal syntax can be used to initialize an object in its entirety:</p>
                        <pre>
<code>var obj = {
  name: "Carrot",
  "for": "Max",
  details: {
    color: "orange",
    size: 12
  }
}</code>
                    </pre>
                        <p>Attribute access can be chained together:</p>
                        <pre>
<code>obj.details.color; // orange
obj["details"]["size"]; // 12</code>
                </section>
                <section>
                    </pre>
                        <p>The following example creates an object prototype, Person, and instance of that prototype, You.</p>
                        <pre><code>function Person(name, age) {
                          this.name = name;
                          this.age = age;
                        }
                        // Define an object
                        var you = new Person("You", 24); </code></pre>
                        <p>We are creating a new person named "you" (that was the first parameter, and the age..)</p>
                        <p>Once created, an object's properties can again be accessed in one of two ways:</p>
                        <pre>
<code>obj.name = "Simon";
var name = obj.name;</code>
                    </pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                    <p>And...</p>
                        <pre>
<code>obj["name"] = "Simon";
var name = obj["name"];</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>These are also semantically equivalent. The second method has the advantage that the name of the property is provided as a string, which means it can be calculated at run-time though using this method prevents some JavaScript engine and minifier optimizations being applied. It can also be used to set and get properties with names that are reserved words:</p>
                        <pre>
<code>obj.for = "Simon"; // Syntax error, because 'for' is a reserved word
obj["for"] = "Simon"; // works fine</code>
                        </pre>
                    </section>
                </section>
            <section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Arrays</h2>
                    <p>Arrays in JavaScript are actually a special type of object. They work very much like regular objects (numerical properties can naturally be accessed only using [] syntax) but they have one magic property called 'length'. This is always one more than the highest index in the array.</p>
                    <p>One way of creating arrays is as follows:</p>
                    <pre>
<code>var a = new Array();
a[0] = "dog";
a[1] = "cat";
a[2] = "hen";
a.length; // 3</code>
                    </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>A more convenient notation is to use an array literal:</p>
                    <pre>
<code>var a = ["dog", "cat", "hen"];
a.length; // 3</code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>Note that array.length isn't necessarily the number of items in the array. Consider the following:</p>
                    <pre>
<code>var a = ["dog", "cat", "hen"];
a[100] = "fox";
a.length; // 101</code>
                    </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Remember — the length of the array is one more than the highest index.</p>
                    <p>If you query a non-existent array index, you'll get a value of undefined returned:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>typeof a[90]; // undefined</code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>If you take the above into account, you can iterate over an array using the following:</p>
                    <pre>
<code>for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
// Do something with a[i]
}</code>
                     </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>This is slightly inefficient as you are looking up the length property once every loop. An improvement is this:</p>
                    <pre>
<code>for (var i = 0, len = a.length; i < len; i++) {
  // Do something with a[i]
}</code>
                </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>A nicer-looking but limited idiom is:</p>
                    <pre>
<code>for (var i = 0, item; item = a[i++];) {
  // Do something with item
}</code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>Here we are setting up two variables. The assignment in the middle part of the for loop is also tested for truthfulness — if it succeeds, the loop continues. Since i is incremented each time, items from the array will be assigned to item in sequential order. The loop stops when a "falsy" item is found (such as undefined).</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>This trick should only be used for arrays which you know do not contain "falsy" values (arrays of objects or DOM nodes for example). If you are iterating over numeric data that might include a 0 or string data that might include the empty string you should use the i, len idiom instead.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>You can iterate over an array using a for...in loop. Note that if someone added new properties to Array.prototype, they will also be iterated over by this loop. Therefore this method is "not" recommended.</p>
                    <p>Another way of iterating over an array that was added with ECMAScript 5 is forEach():</p>
                    <pre>
<code>["dog", "cat", "hen"].forEach(function(currentValue, index, array) {
// Do something with currentValue or array[index]
});</code>
                </pre>
                    <p>If you want to append an item to an array simply do it like this:</p>

                    <pre><code>a.push(item);</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                <p>Arrays come with a number of methods. See also the full documentation for array methods</p>
                    <pre>
<code>a.toString()
//Returns a string with the toString() of each element separated by commas.

a.toLocaleString()  
//Returns a string with the toLocaleString() of each element separated by commas.

a.concat(item1[, item2[, ...[, itemN]]])    
//Returns a new array with the items added on to it.

a.join(sep)     
//Converts the array to a string — with values delimited by the sep param

a.pop()     
//Removes and returns the last item.

a.push(item1, ..., itemN)   
//Adds one or more items to the end.

a.reverse()     
//Reverses the array.

a.shift()   
//Removes and returns the first item.

a.slice(start[, end])   
//Returns a sub-array.

a.sort([cmpfn])     
//Takes an optional comparison function.

a.splice(start, delcount[, item1[, ...[, itemN]]])  
//Lets you modify an array by deleting a section and replacing it with more items.

a.unshift(item1[, item2[, ...[, itemN]]])   
//Prepends items to the start of the array.</code>

                    <h2>Functions</h2>
                    <p>Along with objects, functions are the core component in understanding JavaScript. The most basic function couldn't be much simpler:</p>
                    <pre>
<code>function add(x, y) {
  var total = x + y;
  return total;
}</code>
                </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>This demonstrates a basic function. A JavaScript function can take 0 or more named parameters. The function body can contain as many statements as you like, and can declare its own variables which are local to that function. The return statement can be used to return a value at any time, terminating the function. If no return statement is used (or an empty return with no value), JavaScript returns undefined.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>The named parameters turn out to be more like guidelines than anything else. You can call a function without passing the parameters it expects, in which case they will be set to undefined.</p>
                    <pre><code>add(); // NaN</code></pre> 
                    <p>You can't perform addition on undefined</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>You can also pass in more arguments than the function is expecting:</p>
                    <pre>
<code>add(2, 3, 4); // 5 
added the first two; 4 was ignored</code>
                </pre>
                <p>That may seem a little silly, but functions have access to an additional variable inside their body called arguments, which is an array-like object holding all of the values passed to the function. Let's re-write the add function to take as many values as we want:</p>
                    <pre>
<code>function add() {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0, j = arguments.length; i < j; i++) {
    sum += arguments[i];
  }
  return sum;
}

add(2, 3, 4, 5); // 14</code>
                </pre>
                </section>

                <section>
                        <p>That's really not any more useful than writing 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 though. Let's create an averaging function:</p>

                    <pre>
<code>function avg() {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0, j = arguments.length; i < j; i++) {
    sum += arguments[i];
  }
  return sum / arguments.length;
}

avg(2, 3, 4, 5); // 3.5</code>
                </pre>
            </section>
            <section>

                    <p>This is pretty useful, but introduces a new problem. The avg() function takes a comma separated list of arguments — but what if you want to find the average of an array? You could just rewrite the function as follows:</p>

                    <pre>
<code>function avgArray(arr) {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0, j = arr.length; i < j; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  return sum / arr.length;
}

avgArray([2, 3, 4, 5]); // 3.5</code>
                </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>But it would be nice to be able to reuse the function that we've already created. Luckily, JavaScript lets you call a function and call it with an arbitrary array of arguments, using the apply() method of any function object.</p>

                    <pre><code>avg.apply(null, [2, 3, 4, 5]); // 3.5</code></pre>

                    <p>The second argument to apply() is the array to use as arguments; the first will be discussed later on. This emphasizes the fact that functions are objects too.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>JavaScript lets you create anonymous functions.</p>
                    <pre>
<code>var avg = function() {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0, j = arguments.length; i < j; i++) {
    sum += arguments[i];
  }
  return sum / arguments.length;
};</code>
                </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>This is semantically equivalent to the function avg() form. It's extremely powerful, as it lets you put a full function definition anywhere that you would normally put an expression. This enables all sorts of clever tricks. Here's a way of "hiding" some local variables — like block scope in C:</p>

                    <pre>
<code>var a = 1;
var b = 2;

(function() {
  var b = 3;
  a += b;
})();

a; // 4
b; // 2</code>
                </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>JavaScript allows you to call functions recursively. This is particularly useful for dealing with tree structures, such as those found in the browser DOM.</p>

                    <pre>
<code>function countChars(elm) {
  if (elm.nodeType == 3) { // TEXT_NODE
    return elm.nodeValue.length;
  }
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0, child; child = elm.childNodes[i]; i++) {
    count += countChars(child);
  }
  return count;
}</code>
                    </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                <p>This highlights a potential problem with anonymous functions: how do you call them recursively if they don't have a name? JavaScript lets you name function expressions for this. You can use named IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) as shown below:<p>

                <pre>
<code>var charsInBody = (function counter(elm) {
  if (elm.nodeType == 3) { // TEXT_NODE
    return elm.nodeValue.length;
  }
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0, child; child = elm.childNodes[i]; i++) {
    count += counter(child);
  }
  return count;
})(document.body);</code>
                </pre>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>The name provided to a function expression as above is only available to the function's own scope. This allows more optimizations to be done by the engine and results in more readable code. The name also shows up in the debugger and some stack traces, which can save you time when debugging.</p>

                <p>Note that JavaScript functions are themselves objects — like everything else in JavaScript — and you can add or change properties on them just like we've seen earlier in the Objects section.</p>
