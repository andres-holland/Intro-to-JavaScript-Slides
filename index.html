                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p> Because JavaScript is notorious for being 
                    the world's most misunderstood programming language. While it is 
                    often derided as a toy, beneath its deceptive simplicity lie some 
                    powerful language features. JavaScript is now used by an incredible number of high-profile applications, showing that deeper knowledge of this technology is an important skill for any web or mobile developer.</p>

                                JavaScript is an object-oriented dynamic language with 
                                types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods.
                            </li>
                            <li class="fragment">Syntax is based on the Java and C languages — so many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well.<li>
                            <li class="fragment">One main difference is that functions are objects, giving functions the capacity to hold executable code and be passed around like any other object.

                    <h2>Numbers</h2>
                    <p class="left-align"> Standard arithmetic operators are supported, including addition, subtraction, modulus (or remainder) arithmetic, etc. There's also a built-in object that we forgot to mention earlier called Math that provides advanced mathematical functions and constants</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="left-align">Math.sin(3.5); //-0.35078322768961984
                        </code>
                        <code>var r = 2;
                        <br/>var circumference = Math.PI * (r + r); //12.566370614359172</code>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p class="left-align">You can convert a string to an integer using the built-in parseInt() function. This takes the base for the conversion as an optional second</p>
                        <pre>
                            <code>parseInt("010", 10); // 10d argument, which you should always provide
                            <br/>parseInt("123", 10); // 123
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                         <p class="fragment left-align">If you don't provide the base, you can get surprising results in older browsers (pre-2013):</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                            <code>parseInt("010"); // 8</code>
                        </pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p class="fragment left-align">That happened because the parseInt() function decided to treat the string as octal due to the leading 0. If you want to convert a binary number to an integer, just change the base:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                            <code>parseInt("11", 2); // 3</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p class="fragment left-align">// You can also use the unary + operator to convert values to numbers:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                            <code>+ "42"; // 42</code>
                        </pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p class="left-align">A special value called NaN (short for "Not a Number") is returned if the string is non-numeric:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                            <code>parseInt("hello", 10); // NaN</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p class="fragment left-align">NaN is toxic: if you provide it as an input to any mathematical operation the result will also be NaN:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                            <code>NaN + 5; // NaN</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p class="fragment left-align">You can test for NaN using the built-in isNaN() function:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">

                            <p class="">Strings in JavaScript are sequences of characters. More accurately, they are sequences of Unicode characters, with each character represented by a 16-bit number. This should be welcome news to anyone who has had to deal with internationalization.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                If you want to represent a single character, you just use a string of length 1.
                                <br/>
                                To find the length of a string, access its length property:
                            </p>
                            <pre class="fragment">
                                <code>"hello".length; // 5</code>

                            <p class="">There's our first brush with JavaScript objects! Did we mention that you can use strings like objects too? They have methods as will that allow you to manipulate the string and access information about the string:</p>

                        <h4>Other Types</h4>
                        <div class="left-align">
                            <p class="">JavaScript distinguishes between null, which is a value that indicates a deliberate non-value (and is only accessible through the null keyword), and undefined, which is a value of type undefined that indicates an uninitialized value — that is, a value hasn't even been assigned yet. We'll talk about variables later, but in JavaScript it is possible to declare a variable without assigning a value to it. If you do this, the variable's type is undefined. undefined is actually a constant.JavaScript has a boolean type, with possible values true and false (both of which are keywords.) Any value can be converted to a boolean according to the following rules: <p/>
                            <p class="fragment">false, 0, empty strings (""), NaN, null, and undefined all become false.All other values become true.<p/>
                            <p class="fragment">You can perform this conversion explicitly using the Boolean() function:</p>
                            <pre class="fragment">
                                <code>Boolean("");  // false
                                <br/>
                                Boolean(234); // true</code>
                            </pre>
                            <p class="fragment">However, this is rarely necessary, as JavaScript will silently perform this conversion when it expects a boolean, such as in an if statement (see below.) For this reason, we sometimes speak simply of "true values" and "false values," meaning values that become true and false, respectively, when converted to booleans. Alternatively, such values can be called "truthy" and "falsy", respectively.</p>
                            <p>Boolean operations such as &mp;&amp; (logical and), || (logical or), and ! (logical not) are supported;</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Variables</h2>
                        <div class="left-align">
                            <p>New variables in JavaScript are declared using the var keyword:</p>
                            <pre class="fragment">
                                <code>var a;
                                <br/>var name = "simon";</code>

                            <p>If you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, its type is undefined.</p>
                            <p>An important difference between JavaScript and other languages like Java is that in JavaScript, blocks do not have scope; only functions have scope. So if a variable is defined using var in a compound statement (for example inside an if control structure), it will be visible to the entire function. However, starting with ECMAScript Edition 6, let and const declarations allow you to create block-scoped variables.</p>

                        <h2>Operators</h2>
                        <p>JavaScript's numeric operators are +, -, *, / and % — which is the remainder operator (which is the same as modulo.) Values are assigned using =, and there are also compound assignment statements such as += and -=. These extend out to x = x operator y.</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                            <code>
                            x += 5<br/>
                            x = x + 5
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        <p class="fragment">You can use ++ and -- to increment and decrement respectively. These can be used as prefix or postfix operators.</p>
                        <p>The + operator also does string concatenation:</p>
                        <pre class="fragment">
                        <code>"hello" + " world"; // "hello world"</code>
                        </pre>

                    <section>
                        <p>If you add a string to a number (or other value) everything is converted in to a string first. This might catch you up:</p>

                        <p class="fragment">Comparisons in JavaScript can be made using <, >, <= and >=. These work for both strings and numbers. Equality is a little less straightforward. The double-equals operator performs type coercion if you give it different types, with sometimes interesting results:
                        <pre class="fragment">
                        <code>123 == "123"; // true<br/>1 == true; // true</code>

                    <section>
                        <p>To avoid type coercion and make sure your comparisons are always accurate, you should always use the triple-equals operator:</p>
                        <pre>
                            <code>123 === "123"; // false<br/>1 === true;    // false</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>There are also != and !== operators.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript also has bitwise operations. If you want to use them, they're there</p>

                    <p class="left-align">Remember the three Rs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fragment"><strong>References</strong>: Talk to people who have worked with the developer before. Were they prompt? Pleasant? Forthright?</li>
                        <li class="fragment"><strong>Requirements</strong>: Can they do the work that needs to be done. Ask for samples of their prior work and ask exactly which parts of the process they were responsible for. Design? UX? DB architecture? QA?</li>
                        <li class="fragment"><strong>Reality</strong>: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This website will be a reflection of you, either personally or professionally. Hire someone you feel will be invested in a job well done.</li>
                    </ul>
